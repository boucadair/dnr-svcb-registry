         An Update to the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) Registry
                draft-wb-add-svcb-registry-update-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) IANA registry
   to maintain the set of service parameters that are applicable to
   Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR).  The document also
   includes guidance for new service parameters to indicate whether they
   are eligible to be conveyed in DNR.

   This document updates RFC 9460.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https] established an IANA registry for Service
   Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys) [IANA-SVCB].  That registry is
   leveraged by the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR)
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr].  However, not all service parameters defined in
   that registry are eligible for inclusion in DNR.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] specifies that "ipv4hint" or "ipv6hint" Service
   Parameters (SvcParams) must not be included in DNR because these
   parameters are superseded by the other DNR parameters.

   Given that future SvcParams may be defined in the future, there is
   currently no mechanism to tag whether an SvcParam may or must not be
   included in DNR.  This document fixes that issue by updating the
   structure of the Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys) registry of
   the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry group [IANA-SVCB] to
   maintain the set of service parameters that are applicable to DNR.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Update to Section 14.3.1 of RFC 9460

   This document updates Section 14.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https]
   as follows:

   OLD:  A registration MUST include the following fields:  Number: wire
         format numeric identifier (range 0-65535)

         Name: unique presentation name

         Meaning: a short description

         Format Reference: pointer to specification text

         Change Controller: Person or entity, with contact information
         if appropriate.

   NEW:  A registration MUST include the following fields:  Number: wire
         format numeric identifier (range 0-65535)

         Name: unique presentation name

         Meaning: a short description

         Applicable to DNR (Y/N): an indication whether a the parameter
         is applicable to DNR [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] or not.

         Format Reference: pointer to specification text

         Change Controller: Person or entity, with contact information
         if appropriate.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations other
   than those discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   Section 12 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document request IANA to update the Service Parameter Keys
   (SvcParamKeys) registry of the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry
   group [IANA-SVCB] as follows:

   *  Add a new column entitled "Applicable to DNR (Y/N)".  The new
      column must be added right after the "Meaning" column.

   *  Set "Applicable to DNR" to "Y" for "alpn", "port", and "dohpath".
      Set "Applicable to DNR" to "N" for the other remaining entries.

   *  Update the reference of the registry to list the RFC:

   OLD:  [RFC-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-12]

   NEW:  [RFC-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-12][This_Document]
