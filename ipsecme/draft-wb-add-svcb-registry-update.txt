         An Update to the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) Registry
                draft-wb-add-svcb-registry-update-latest

Abstract

   This document updates the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) IANA registry
   to indicate which service parameters are applicable to protocols
   where duplicated information in those parameters can cause
   interoperability problems.  The document also includes guidance for
   new service parameters to indicate whether they should be conveyed or
   withheld.

   This document updates RFC 9460.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https] established an IANA registry for Service
   Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys) [IANA-SVCB].  That registry is
   leveraged by the Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR)
   [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike].  However, not all service parameters
   defined in that registry are eligible for inclusion in those
   protocols.  For example, both [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike] specify that "ipv4hint" and "ipv6hint"
   Service Parameters (SvcParams) must not be included in these
   protocols because these parameters are superseded by the other
   parameters of those protocols.

   Given that future SvcParams may be defined in the future, there is
   currently no mechanism to tag whether an SvcParam may or must not be
   included in DNR or IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS.  This document fixes that
   issue by updating the structure of the Service Parameter Keys
   (SvcParamKeys) registry of the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry
   group [IANA-SVCB] to maintain the set of service parameters that are
   applicable to those specifications.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Update to Section 14.3.1 of RFC 9460

   This document updates Section 14.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https]
   as follows:

   OLD:

   A registration MUST include the following fields:

   *  Number: wire format numeric identifier (range 0-65535)

   *  Name: unique presentation name

   *  Meaning: a short description

   *  Format Reference: pointer to specification text

   *  Change Controller: Person or entity, with contact information if
      appropriate.

   NEW:

   A registration MUST include the following fields:

   *  Number: wire format numeric identifier (range 0-65535)

   *  Name: unique presentation name

   *  Meaning: a short description

   *  Applicable to DNR and IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS (Y/N): an indication
      whether the parameter is included in messages sent by DNR
      [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] and IKEv2 for Encrypted DNS
      [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike].

   *  Format Reference: pointer to specification text

   *  Change Controller: Person or entity, with contact information if
      appropriate.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations other
   than those discussed in Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-add-dnr], Section 6 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-add-ike], and Section 12 of
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document request IANA to update the Service Parameter Keys
   (SvcParamKeys) registry of the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry
   group [IANA-SVCB] as follows:

   *  Add a new column entitled "Applicable to DNR and IKEv2 for
      Encrypted DNS (Y/N)".  The new column must be added right after
      the "Meaning" column.

   *  Set "Applicable to DNR and IKEv2 for Ecnrypted DNS" to "Y" for
      "alpn", "port", and "dohpath", and set to "N" for the other
      remaining entries.

   *  Update the reference of the registry to list the RFC:

      OLD:  [RFC-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-12]

      NEW:  [RFC-ietf-dnsop-svcb-https-12][This_Document]
